<h2>Is CD Ripping Legal?</h2>
<p>If you are in the United States, converting an original CD to digital files is considered "Fair Use". So you aren't violating US copyright law, as long as you are just downloading the files for your own personal use. However, if you download files from a CD and then distribute that copyrighted material to others, that is not considered "fair use" and is illegal.</p>
