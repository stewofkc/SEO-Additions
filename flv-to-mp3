<h2>What is .mp3?</h2>
<p>MP3 files are a file format for storing digital music and other audio files. .mp3 is likely the most widely used audio file format. These files were originally developed by The Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) as part of a compression system for media files. The third layer of MPEG files was for audio, hence the name MP3. When converted to .mp3, audio files can be compressed by 10 to 12 times, while retaining their sound quality. Part of creating an MP3 file is "sampling". Sampling is essentially the number of sounds that a computer records per second when transmitting audio information from an analog to digital format. What makes .mp3 files so impressive is that they are able to highly compress audio files, while maintaining high audio quality.</p>
