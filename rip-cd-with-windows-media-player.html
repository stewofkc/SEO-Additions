<h2><strong>How To Rip a CD with Windows Media Player</strong></h2>
<p>"Ripping" refers to copying the contents of a CD to your computer's hard drive. If you have a large CD collection and want to transfer those files onto your computer, CD ripping is the most effective way to do it. Once you have those files on your computer, you can transfer those files to your smartphone and take those songs with you anywhere.</p>

<p>Windows Media Player is included with Windows 10 and can be used to rip files off of CDs. First, insert the CD you want to rip into your CD drive and open Windows Media Player. Then select the "Rip CD" button. You'll be shown a window with different options for which format you want to use when downloading the files. We recommend using .mp3 files because they are most likely to work on all of your devices. The files you've downloaded should appear in your "Music" folder.</p>
